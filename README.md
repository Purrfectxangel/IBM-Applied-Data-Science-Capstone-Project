# ðŸš€ Machine Learning Project - SpaceX Rocket Launch Prediction
This is a step-by-step data science project for the Data Science Certification Program offered by IBM. 
The main goal of this project is to determine the price of each SpaceX rocket launch using publicly available data.
## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
We will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
## ðŸ“„ Questions to Answer
1. Find out how variables like payload mass, orbit, booster version, or launch site affect the landing outcome.
2. Which machine learning model is the best one to predict landing outcome?
## ðŸ“„ Methodology
- Data collection methodology:
  1. Data collection using SpaceX API
  2. Data collection vis Web Scraping on Wikipedia	
- Perform dataÂ wrangling
  1. Filtering out necessary data
  2. Dealing with Missing Data
  3. One hot converting to convert categorical data into binary format
  4. Determine Training Labels
